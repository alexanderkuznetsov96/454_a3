CISC/CMPE 454 Assignment 3
Due Wednesday, April 11 before 6:00pm

You may work in groups of two.  Graduate students must work individually.

You are to implement pixel antialiasing (with and without jittering),
glossy reflection, and soft shadows in a raytracer.

In the supplied code, replace "YOUR CODE HERE" with your own code.
You only have to modify scene.cpp.

Build a scene that shows all three effects at once.

You should first spend at least three hours looking at the code and
understanding it.  If you do not do this, the assignment will take
much longer.

This code only works on Linux.  (When ported to Windows, it does not
correctly draw spheres and debugging arrows, so you should not spend
the time trying to get it running on Windows.)

Run the code with the name of a world on the command line, like

   ./rt worlds/testBasic

Once it runs, press '?' to see in the terminal window a list of actions.

To Hand In

  Make a directory called 'a3'.  In that directory, put ONLY THREE FILES:

    - scene.cpp

    - a README file with your name(s), student number(s) again, and
      email address(es)

    - one screen captured image of your program output, showing
      antialiasing, shadows, and glossy reflection.

  Create a ZIP archive of the a3 directory.

  Email the archive to jstewart@cs.queensu.ca

We will take your scene.cpp file and will compile it on the CasLab
Linux machines with the rest of the code provided for the assignment.
Marks will be deducted if your scene.cpp code not compile and run on
the CasLab Linux machines.
